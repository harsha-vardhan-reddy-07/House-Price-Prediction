# House-Price-Prediction

This is a Regression project to predict Housing Prices using the dataset collected from a Kaggle competition.
* This is just made for educational purpose.
* In this, I used only one model for prediction(RandomForestRegressor), but it's adviced to try various models which might yield better results.
* Usage of different machine learning models should be done using trail & error method.
* After sticking a model, it's recommended to tune it's hyperpaarameters which might yield even better results.
